### Project steps:

* Create an image dataset
   - Split the video into frames
   - Add new images data to prevent overfitting and achieve versatile performance
   - Perform augmentation to achieve the optimum result for a dynamic environment
   - Data labeling 
* Training CNN model (YOLO Algorithm)
* Code                
   - Initialize Model
   - Cars Detection
   - Draw Detections
   - Objects Tracking and Counting
