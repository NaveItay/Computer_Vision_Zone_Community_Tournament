### Project steps:

* Create an image dataset
  1. Split the video into frames
  2. Add new images data to prevent overfitting and achieve versatile performance
  3. Perform augmentation to achieve the optimum result for a dynamic environment
  4. Data labeling 
* Training custom CNN model (YOLO Algorithm)
* Code                
   - Initialize Model
   - Cars Detection
   - Count and track cars that are only in the region of interest.
   - Draw result
